This project is a part of the [AREDN Cloud Tunnel](https://github.com/USA-RedDragon/aredn-cloud-tunnel) project. Unless you're developing for the project, you probably want to go there instead.

This project is a glorified VTun and OLSR configuration generator with an API and web interface. It is designed to be run in the [aredn-base](https://github.com/USA-RedDragon/aredn-base) Docker container.

## Development

This project has a Golang backend and embeds a Vue frontend.
